	  <dd>The 3D-DART server generates 3D structural models of double stranded DNA in either A-form or B-form. The modeling process requires 
	   a initial template base-pair(step) parameter file representing the 3D conformation of a DNA starting structure. This parameter file is
	   subsequently used in further modeling actions. The template parameter file can be built in three different ways:
	  <dd class="publication"> 
	   <ul>
		<li>From a straight &quot;canonical&quot; model with a user-defined base-pair sequence. This uses 
                    the &quot;fiber&quot; module from the 3DNA software package to generate the canonical 3D model and 
                    subsequently the &quot;find_pair&quot; and &quot;analyze&quot; modules
                    from the same software to obtain the base-pair(step) parameter file.</li>
		<li>From a user-uploaded base-pair(step) parameter file.</li>
		<li>From another template 3D structure of a DNA in PDB format. This structure is be analyzed using the &quot;find_pair&quot; and 
			&quot;analyze&quot; modules from 3DNA to obtain the base-pair(step) parameter file.</li>
	   </ul>
	  </dd>
	  <dd>The six base-pair and six base-pair step parameters (Fig. 1) in the generated parameter file can almost completely describe the conformation 
	   of a double stranded nucleic acid structure. Lu <em>et al</em></a> have indeed demonstrated (using there program 
	   <a href="http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/~xiangjun/3DNA/">3DNA</a>) that rebuilding a double stranded nucleic acid structure using these parameters 
	   results in a near native structure. The only exceptions are local changes in the sugar and phosphate backbone conformations.</dd>
	  <div align="center"><img src="./media/bp_step.png" width="466" height="302" /></div>
      <dd style="text-align:center">Figure 1. The six base-pair (left) and base-pair step (right) parameters. Source: <a href=
       "http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/~xiangjun/3DNA/">3DNA website</a></dd>
      <dd>The 3D-DART web server makes use of these parameters to introduce custom changes in the structural models. Conformational modifications are divided 
       into a global and local level. Modifications on a global level result in a bending, kinking and twisting behavior of the structure. These modifications are 
       governed by the base-pair step parameters. Base-pair parameters operate on a local level and do not influence the global structure during the modeling 
       procedure.<br/>
       A bend angle in a base-pair step has two values associated with it: the magnitude of the angle and its direction in Euler-angle space. 
       The origin in the Euler-angle space is set at a user-defined reference base-pair. The direction of a bend in an arbitrary base-pair is 
       calculated relative to the reference base-pair.<br/>
       The base-pair parameters Tilt, Roll and Twist are ideal for creating the bend. Both Roll and Tilt allow 
       one base-pair to be tilted relative to another. Roll generates the most pronounced bend. The direction of the bend in Euler-angle space caused by Roll 
	   is positioned 90&deg; to the plane in which the tilt generates a bend. By combining Roll and Tilt we can span 360&deg;. Because the 
	   double stranded nucleic aid is twisted, we need to correct the direction of the introduced bend angle for the value of Twist. The &quot;Custom Build tool&quot; 
       allows the user to define the magnitude of the bend, its direction relative to the reference base-pair and the range of base-pairs over which to bend. 
       If the range is large, this results in a smooth bend; if the range is small, this results in a kink. The user can generate a single model with a fixed bend angle and 
       direction or a set of models by defining minimum and maximum values for the angle and direction as well as a sample interval. Total control can be achieved by 
       supplying a custom set of angle and direction values for every individual base-pair step in a given range.<br/>
       Additional fine-tuning of the structures at a local level can be done by providing custom values for the remaining 6 base-pair and 4 base-pair step parameters.
       You will be able to define one fixed value that will be used for every base-pair and base-pair step in the sequence. If you wish to vary the value 
       at give base-pair steps you can upload your own version of the base-pair (step) parameter file that will be used for modeling. Alternatively you can upload 
       another DNA structure, in PDB format, that will be used a starting model for the introduction of additional conformational changes.</dd>
      <dd>The 3D models generated by 3D-DART can be used as starting structures for the macro-molecular docking program <a href="http://haddock.chem.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK/">HADDOCK</a>
	   also developed in our group. The successful use of DNA in this program requires the structure file to have a fixed layout and an accompanying DNA-specific restraints 
       file that defines several restraints to preserve the helical structure of the DNA during the docking process.</br>
	   If you make use of the <a href="http://haddock.chem.uu.nl/services/HADDOCK/">HADDOCK server</a> to do your docking than this will all be done automatically. For users that operate HADDOCK locally on their own computational
	   infrastructure the 3D-DART server offers the additional option to properly format the PDB files of the generated models and generate a restraint file for them.</dd>

	  <dd>Please NOTE: the global nucleic acid conformations introduced using 
	   this server rely on strict geometrical principles. Depending on your settings they do not have to reflect a energetically favorable conformation. For example:
	   you can introduce a 90&deg; bend between two base-pairs in a sequence. Visual inspection of the structure will however immediately show you that the
	   sugar-phosphate backbone is broken in half.</dd>

      <dd>The first step in the modeling process involves the definition of the source for the template base-pair(step) parameter file and the type
	   of DNA used in modeling</dd>
      <dd><strong>Give your structure a name:</strong>
       The name you provide here will be used for all generated structure or structure-related files. If no name is provided the default name 
       &quot;dna&quot; or the name of the uploaded base-pair(step) parameter file will be used.</dd>
      <dd><strong>Define the nucleic acid sequence (5'->3'):</strong>
       Enter the desired nucleic acid sequence using a one-letter notation for the bases (A,T,C and G). Both small case and capital letters 
       are accepted. Non-supported base notations and white spaces will be ignored. The sequence will serve as the template strand in 
       the 5'-3' direction.</dd>
      <dd><strong>Number of repeats:</strong>
       State how many times you would like the defined sequence to be repeated. The default is 1</dd>
      <dd><strong>Build from user defined parameter file:</strong>
       If desired you can build models from a predefined base-pair(step) parameter file. De DNA structure will be rebuilt according to the 
       specification in this parameter file. Modifications that you make afterwards, like the introduction of a bend, will be introduced in the 
       structure in a non-destructive manner. That is, only the base-pair step parameter necessary to introduce the bend will be changed while all 
       other parameters will remain the same as in the uploaded parameter file.<br/>
       The base-pair(step) parameter file is in a format as used by 3DNA. Figure 2 illustrates the layout of the parameter file. 
       The first row indicates the total number of base-pairs in the structure. The third row indicates the 6 base-pair and 6 base-pair step 
       parameters respectively. The following rows indicate the base-pair (1th column) and the values for the base-pair and base-pair step 
       parameters. By convention the very first base-pair does not have a corresponding base-pair step associated to it and therefore the 
       base-pair step parameters all bear the value 0.00. You can download an example file 
       <a href="./media/examplepar.par"><strong>here</strong></a> for you to edit and experiment with.</dd>

      <dd><strong>Build from PDB structure file</strong>
	   You can upload a PDB structure file of a dsDNA containing system. The DNA in the system is 
analyzed and a base-pair(step) parameter file
	   describing the conformation of the DNA is generated. This parameter file will subsequently serve as a starting point for the model generation
	   procedure</dd>
      <dd><strong>Nucleic acid type:</strong>
       Choose the type of double stranded nucleic acid you would like to build. Options are: BDNA, ADNA and NDB96. The NDB96 set includes base 
       and C1&acute; atoms, without sugar-phosphate backbone. ADNA set uses C3&acute; -endo sugar-backbone conformation as defined by Leslie 
       <em>et al.</em> (1980) fiber studies, but with a &chi; torsion angle of -157&deg;, average of high resolution single crystal X-ray 
       oligonucleotide structures. BDNA set is similarly defined as ADNA except for a C3&acute; -endo sugar fiber sugar-backbone conformation 
       and the -108&deg; &chi; torsion angle.</dd>

      <dd><strong>Building models as a Calladine-Drew plot:</strong>
       The Calladine-Drew style representation of nucleic acid structures uses a block representation of base-pairs. This representation provides 
       a clear view on the effects of base-pair and base-pair step parameters on the conformation of your structure. The representation is generated 
       in ALCHEMY format and results in files having the suffix .alc and must be viewed in a ALCHEMY capable molecule viewer such as RasMol. 
       You can choose to generate your ALCHEMY models using either the one block per base-pair or two blocks per base-pair option. 
       You can generate Calladine-Drew plots together with structures in atomic representation in the same run.</dd>

      <dd>In step 2 of the modeling process you are able to introduce custom bend angles and custom values for the base-pair(step) parameters into
	   the structure generated in step 1. The introduction of a bend involves setting up-to 3 parameters:</dd>
	  <dd class='publication'> 
	   <ul>
		<li>The bend angle: Defines the magnitude of the bend angle in degrees between every successive base-pair. If nothing is set nothing will be
			changed.</li>
		<li>The bend orientation: Defines the direction of the bend angle in degrees between every successive base-pair. If nothing is set a default 
			orientation angle of 45&deg; is used</li>
		<li>The bend zone: the range of base-pairs for which the bend angle and/or orientation needs to be changed. If nothing is set the full sequence
		    is used</li> 
	   </ul>
	  </dd>
	  <dd>The way you need to define values in order to obtain the desired result depends on the modeling mode (global or local). A 
	   full description of the settings with examples is given below.<dd>
	  <dd><strong>Modelling mode:</strong>
	   By default this options is set to &quot;global&quot; meaning that the defined bend angle will be distributed evenly over the defined zone. By switching the 
	   modelling mode to &quot;local&quot; the user can set the bend angle and/or the bend angle orientation on a per base-pair step basis.</dd>
      <dd><strong>Define bend angle range:</strong>
	   This parameter defines the magnitude of the bend angle in degrees between every successive base-pair. If nothing is set than nothing is changed.
	   The allowed values for this parameter depend on the modelling mode:</dd>
	  <dd class="publication">
	   <ul>
	    <li>Global: The defined bend is evenly distributed over the sequence. Defining one bend value will bend the sequence in the defined zone by the set angle. 
		    A angle range can be defined as &quot;10-30&quot;. In this case multiple models will be generated within the range from 10&deg; to 30&deg; with
		    a step size as defined in &quot;bend-angle step size&quot;.</li>
		<li>Local: The defined bend angles are specific for a given base-pair step. If you specify a custom angle for every base-pair step in the sequence you do not
			need to set a zone. If you specify a custom set of angles for a specific region in the sequence you need to specify this region in the 
			&quot;bend zone&quot; field.</li>   
	   </ul>
	  </dd>			 
  	  <dd><strong>Define bend-angle step size:</strong>
       This defines the step size with which an angle range is sampled. This option can only be set if working in the &quot;Global&quot; modeling mode. 
	   If nothing is set a default of 1 will be used</dd>
      <dd><strong>Define bend zone:</strong>
       Defines the base-pair range in which a given bend is introduced. The syntax is for example &quot;5-10&quot; where 5 is the start base-pair and
	   10 the end base-pair. If nothing is set the full sequence will be defined as bend zone. The syntax is the same for both modeling modes.  However, be careful 
	   in the &quot;Local&quot; mode since every base-pair in the zone needs to be associated with a custom bend angle and/or bend angle orientation value.</dd>
      <dd><strong>Define bend angle orientation range:</strong>
       This parameter defines the orientation of the bend angle in degrees relative to the reference frame between every successive base-pair. 
	   The allowed values for this parameter depend on the modelling mode:</dd>
	  <dd class="publication">
	   <ul>
	    <li>Global: Defining one bend angle orientation value will apply that value to every angle as defined in the &quot;Define bend angle range&quot; field.
		    A orientation range can be defined as &quot;10-30&quot;. In this case multiple models will be generated within the range from 10&deg; to 30&deg; with
		    a step size as defined in &quot;bend-angle orientation step size&quot;.</li>
		<li>Local: The defined bend angle orientations are specific for a given base-pair step. If you specify a custom orientation for every base-pair step in the 
			sequence you do not need to set a zone. If you specify a custom set of orientations for a specific region in the sequence you need to specify this region 
			in the &quot;bend zone&quot; field.</li>   
	   </ul>
	  </dd>
      <dd><strong>Define bend angle orientation step size:</strong>
       This defines the step size by which an angle range orientation is sampled. This option can only be set if working in the &quot;Global&quot; modeling mode.</dd>
      <dd><strong>Base-pair used as origin in global reference frame:</strong>
       This defines the origin of the global reference frame used for calculating the bend angle magnitude and orientation. Definition of this parameter
	   is optional, by default the middle base-pair of the zone is used.</dd>
	  <dd><strong>Define the helical phase:</strong>
       This defines the number of base-pairs in one helical turn by changing the Twist value for every base-pair step. If no value is defined a default of 10 bp/turn
       will be used. If you define a custom Twist value to be used for modelling, than this will override the helical phasing.</dd>
	  <dd><strong>Use custom defined values for base-pair and base-pair step parameters:</strong>
       If you wish to use other values for the base-pair and base-pair step parameters than those defined by default you can set them in the   
       appropriate boxes. All the values for the given parameter will be set to this new custom value. Other values will not be affected.</dd>

      <dd><strong>DNA/RNA restraints file:</strong>
      When using double stranded nucleic acids in HADDOCK an additional set of restraints is required to maintain the helical conformation of the
      structure. This file, always called dna-rna_restraints.def, defines the following restraints:</dd>
      <dd class='publication'>
	   <ul>
		<li>Watson-Crick base-pair planarity restraints</li>
		<li>Ring planarity restraints for the bases</li>
		<li>Watson-Crick hydrogen bond restraints</li>
		<li>Ribose sugar pucker restraints</li>
		<li>Sugar-phosphate backbone dihedral angles restraints</li>
	   </ul>		
	  </dd>
	  <dd>When you use this option, the restraint file will be automatically generated based on the DNA models you created. Since this restraint file
	  is intended for use in HADDOCK, the DNA models will be formated for correct use in HADDOCK (the option &quot;Prepare PDB files for use in HADDOCK&quot;
	  will be checked)<br/>
	  Their are a number of settings in the dna-rna_restraints.def file that you can define in the web-form.</dd>
	  <dd><i>Planarity restraints</i></dd>
      <dd>The planarity of the individual base rings is restrained by default. Optionally you can restrain the two bases of a Watson-Crick base-pair to be
	   in the same plane. The flexibility of the system in the flexible phase of the docking will be reduced significantly when this option is checked.
	   Alternatively, one can use Watson-Crick base-pair restraint to restrain the length of the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds. With this, the bases
	   in a pair can still move relative to one another without unpairing.</dd>
      <dd><i>Watson-Crick base-pair restraints</i></dd>
	  <dd>This option restrains the length of the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds between the defined upper and lower bounds. With the individual
	   bases of a base-pair are still able to move relative to on another without unpairing.</dd>
	  <dd><i>Set sugar-pucker dihedral angle restraints</i></dd>
	  <dd>Sugar-pucker dihedral angles are restrained during the docking. The values for the dihedral angles (as shown in table 1) and the error range 
	   within which the value is restrained can be defined. The value of the dihedral angle restraints can be defined in four different ways:</dd>
      <dd class="publication">
	   <ul>
		<li>&quot;Pick the dihedral angles of the sugar pucker from the input structure &quot; This is the default option. It measures the dihedral angles 
		 from the input structure(s) and restrain them within a default error range as shown in table 1. You must define the groups of residues for which you 
		 wish to setup the restraints. You can define up-to 3 groups. Within each group you have to define the start and end residue</li>
	    <li>The dihedral angles can be restrained to match the average values of standard B-form DNA (see table 1). To use this option set the conformation of each 
		 defined group to &quot;B-form&quot;</li>
  	    <li>The dihedral angles can be restrained to match the average values of standard A-form DNA (see table 1). To use this option set the conformation of each
	     defined group to &quot;A-form&quot;</li>
	    <li>You can define custom values for the sugar pucker dihedral angle by setting the conformation of each group to &quot;User defined&quot; and specifying 
		 the value of the custom dihedral angle and its error range</li>
	   </ul>
	  </dd>		 
      <dd>Option 1 is set by default and preferred if you want to ensure a dynamical behavior of your nucleic acid during the docking. The restraint file is 
	   used in both the semi-flexible torsion angle dynamics refinement stage and in the final water refinement. If option 1 is used the angles of the input 
           structures are measured and restrained at the start of both stages. This allows for more conformational freedom of the nucleic acid backbone 
           during the docking. If any other option is used, the dihedral angles are restrained around fixed values and the conformational freedom will be reduced.</dd>

      <dd><strong>Some P-O3' bonds in the sugar-phosphate backbone of bend structures seem to be longer than physically possible. 
	   What is going on?</strong></dd>
      <dd>The 3D-DART server calculates how the base-pairs in the sequence are supposed to be oriented relative to one another to result in the user-defined
	   global conformation like a kink or bend. The &quot;rebuild&quot; module of 3DNA then uses this information to position the 
	   atomic coordinates of the different nucleotides to generate the actual structure. The calculation however only considers the
	   individual bases to modify the global conformation and not the sugar-phosphate backbone; as a consequence, the backbone will 
	   always remains in the same conformation. To link the nucleotides together via the P-O3' bond the &quot;rebuild&quot; module does not use an
	   energy minimization procedure but instead writes a CONECT statement to the PDB file that will command a structure viewer to create the
	   bond. This will give the impression that nucleotides are properly linked even if the distance between P-O3' is too long for an actual bond
	   to occur.</dd>
