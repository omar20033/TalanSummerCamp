# The following list gives the correspondence between a uncommon base with
# its canonical counterparts: A, C, G, I, T and U. It is based on an
# analysis of all the NDB entries and a careful check of each residue given
# here, and is intended to make analyzing nucleic acid structures with
# unusual base residues easier.

# New base residues can be added to this list following the same format.

# The format of this list is: three-letter residue name as in a PDB file
# followed by a one-letter, one line per pair. Those with less the
# three-letter will be prepended with space. For each base X here, there are
# should be a file name Atomic_X.pdb in your current directory or $X3DNA.

# An empty line or a line STARTING with # is a comment.

# common residues: in upper case
